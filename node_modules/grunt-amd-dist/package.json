  "readme": "grunt-amd-dist\n=============\n\ngrunt-amd-dist is a [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task to build JavaScript\nprojects which use the AMD format.\n\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`\n\n\nInstallataion\n-------------\n\nFrom the same directory as your Gruntfile, run\n\n```\nnpm install grunt-amd-dist\n```\n\nThen add the following line to your Gruntfile:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-amd-dist');\n```\n\nYou can verify that the task is available by running `grunt --help` and\nchecking that \"amd-dist\" is under \"Available tasks\".\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\ngrunt-amd-dist reads two sections of your config: `amd-dist` and `requirejs`.\n`amd-dist` can contain these properties (example from\n[deferreds.js](https://github.com/zship/deferreds.js)):\n\n```js\n'amd-dist': {\n\tall: {\n\t\toptions: {\n\t\t\t//remove requirejs dependency from built package (almond)\n\t\t\tstandalone: true,\n\t\t\t//build standalone for node or browser\n\t\t\tenv: 'node',\n\t\t\t//env: 'browser',\n\t\t\texports: 'deferreds'\n\t\t},\n\t\t//Grunt files configuration object for which to trace dependencies\n\t\t//(more: http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks)\n\t\tfiles: [{\n\t\t\tsrc: 'src/deferreds/**/*.js',\n\t\t\tdest: 'dist/deferreds.js'\n\t\t}]\n\t}\n},\n```\n\n`requirejs` is a standard [r.js configuration\nobject](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/example.build.js).\ngrunt-amd-dist uses `basePath`, `paths`, and `packages` (all optional) to\ntransform file names to AMD module names.  If the `mainConfigFile`\nproperty is given, the configuration in that file will be mixed-in to the\n`requirejs` property with a **lower** precedence (that is, in the case of a\nconflicting configuration property, `requirejs` will always \"win\" against\n`mainConfigFile`).\n\nOnce these options are in place, `grunt amd-dist` will run grunt-amd-dist.\n\n\n### Standalone build\n\nThe `standalone` option will cause the built file to export an object\ncontaining all AMD modules which were part of the build. Depending on the `env`\noption, this returned object is assigned to `module.exports` (node) or\n`window.<config:dist.exports>`. Object keys are the module names, values are the\nmodules.\n\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nThe [r.js optimizer](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js) already performs the main\npurpose of grunt-amd-dist, so why use this grunt task? Well, the main use case\nfor grunt-amd-dist is building library projects, where a build should include\nall files. Normally, AMD libraries should be used as-is and built by the\nconsumer as part of their own projects' builds (to minimize the amount of\nlibrary code included to what is actually used). A library built through\ngrunt-amd-dist, then, would normally be intended as an alternative for consumers who\ndo not want to use an AMD loader. With that in mind, here's what grunt-amd-dist\nprovides:\n\n1. Can specify files instead of module names, and use grunt's\n   [globbing](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/0.3-stable/docs/api_file.md#gruntfileexpand)\n   to cut down on typing included files explicitly.\n2. Built script can export an object containing all included modules, for use\n   outside AMD loaders.\n3. Can export for node or browsers.\n",
